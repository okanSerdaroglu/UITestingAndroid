** You can define an activityScenario in 2 different ways

   First way :
       @get: Rule
       val activityRule = ActivityScenarioRule(SecondaryActivity::class.java)

   Second way for in each test :
        val activityScenario = ActivityScenario.launch(MainActivity::class.java)

** @RunWith(Suite::class)
   @Suite.SuiteClasses(
       MainActivityTest::class,
       SecondaryActivityTest::class
   ) means that run MainActivityTest and SecondaryActivityTest classes together
